        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am a second-year UG student in computer science at the University of Rochester, advised by <a href="https://aaronstevenwhite.io/" target="_blank">Aaron White</a>. My research interests lie broadly in natural language understanding and information extraction, but my more specific interests within these areas are diverse. Some recent projects include:
          <ol>
		  <li>Developing models for cross-lingual event and arguments identification with <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/", target="_blank">Ben Van Durme</a>'s group as part of <a href="https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/better" target="_blank"> IARPA BETTER</a>.
          <li>Learning and representing the structure of events and the relations between them as part of the <a href="http://decomp.io/" target="_blank">Decompositional Semantics</a> initiative.</li>
          <li>Combining mixed effects models with neural models for improved natural language inference.</li>
          </ol>
	  Through collaborations, I have also engaged in work that is perhaps more within the domain of linguistics proper. Along these lines, I have recently been investigating lexically-triggered belief and desire inferences with Aaron White and <a href="https://cs.rochester.edu/u/bkane2/", target="_blank">Ben Kane</a>, looking at how these inferences pattern with other types of inference (veridicality, factivity, and negation-raising) and with syntactic distribution. You can see our work <a href="http://megaattitude.io/projects/mega-intensionality/", target="_blank">here</a>. A more or less up-to-date list of publications can be found on my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SpOIH2MAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Google Scholar page</a>.</p>
        <p>Previously, I graduated from Jiangsu Tianyi High School.
